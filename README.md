🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on historical data using machine learning classification models. By analyzing features like passenger class, gender, age, and family size, the model determines the likelihood of survival.

📂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic Dataset. It includes:

train.csv: Training data with survival labels

test.csv: Data for making predictions

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy – Data Processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization

Scikit-Learn – Model Training

Jupyter Notebook/Colab – Implementation

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately
🔹 Visualized survival rates based on class, gender, and family size
🔹 Transformed categorical data into numerical format using one-hot encoding

🚀 Model Implementation
Steps Followed:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2️⃣ Feature Engineering & Selection
3️⃣ Model Training – Random Forest Classifier
4️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning
5️⃣ Evaluation & Performance Metrics

Algorithm Used:
✅ Random Forest Classifier – Chosen for its accuracy & feature importance

📌 Results & Key Insights
📊 Achieved ~80% accuracy in predicting survival
📊 Gender & class were the most influential survival factors
📊 1st-class passengers had a much higher survival rate
📌 Next Steps
🔹 Experimenting with XGBoost & Neural Networks for better accuracy
